                    <p>The Mazda MX-5 is one of the very best enthusiast’s cars on sale, regardless of its relatively low price. There aren’t many small, fun, rear-wheel-drive sports cars available on the modern market, so most of the MX-5’s rivals are actually front-drive hot hatchbacks.</p>

                  <p>Porsche’s latest 911 is the most complete yet; it’s fast, sophisticated and entirely usable in everyday life. The current crop of Carrera S and 4S models are just as fast as the Carrera GTS from the previous generation, such is the pace of the 911’s continued evolution

                    <p>Drawing from a rich history of rear-engined sports and racing cars, the latest Alpine A110 is styled to look and feel much like the French brand’s iconic sixties offering of the same name. But with a mid-mounted turbocharged four-cylinder engine, dual-clutch gearbox and a perfectly judged chassis, the A110 is far more modern than its retro-styled bodywork may have you believe. Rivals are more practical, but the Alpine stands as the best choice for keen drivers who want to stand out.</p>

                    <p>The Porsche 718 Boxster and Cayman are the German manufacturer’s entry-level roadster and coupe models, with each offering a similar blend of performance and handling that has seen them remain among our favourite sports machines for years. The standard car gets 296bhp, but S models receive a boost to 345bhp.

                    <p>Divisive looks aside, the latest versions of BMW’s M3 saloon and M4 coupe continue their tradition of mastering both road and track, while all wrapped up in a package that’s easy to use as an everyday car, should you choose to. The two latest models have been given a major overhaul - with four-wheel-drive and the latest six-cylinder twin turbocharged ‘S58’ engine being two of the most notable upgrades.

                    <p>The 720S was designed with the likes of the Lamborghini Huracan and the Ferrari 488 firmly in its sights, and taking on these two goliath brands is not an easy feat for most. Fortunately for McLaren, an abundance of technological expertise and long-standing motorsport pedigree have helped shape the 720S into a fearsome opponent.

                    <p>The main story with the M2 Competition is under the bonnet, where you’ll find a ballistic 404bhp 3.0-litre twin turbocharged six-cylinder. This engine has dramatically changed the car’s character - despite the two turbos, the engine is responsive and feels more connected to your right foot than other recent M cars, and this sensation is enhanced by a more natural-sounding exhaust note.

                    <p>The Toyota Supra’s return has been a controversial one. 17 years after the much-loved Mk4 Supra ended production, Toyota finally brought back the Supra name. While the internet may have briefly been in uproar over the amount of input BMW had during development, no one can deny the new Supra is an exquisite driver’s car

                    <h2 class="lg-heading"><strong> Ford Mustang</strong></h2>
                    <p>In terms of value, the Ford is miles ahead of its rivals. The Mustang GT has the same output as Porsche’s latest 911 Carrera S – 444bhp – but starts at just over £50,000 less.Your £44,000 gets you a 5.0-litre V8 and a 0-62mph time of 4.3 seconds, with a limited top speed of 155mph. It’s not as refined, polished, well built or composed as its more costly rivals, yet little can detract from its wealth of character. Enthusiasts will certainly never tire of the noise from its quad tailpipes.

                    <h2 class="lg-heading"><strong> Nissan GT-R</strong></h2>
                    <p>Famous for its supercar-baiting performance, the GT-R is a unique proposition in the sports car market. Off-the-line acceleration is remarkable, as is outright speed. Powered by a hand-built 3.8-litre twin-turbo V6 developing 562bhp, and with an array of driver-assist systems, it’s perhaps the most effortlessly quick sports car on sale. Light, fast steering and a dialled-in chassis give great agility, while wide tyres and quick-witted 4WD come together to provide huge reserves of grip.</p>
