                    <p>The Ghost was a line in the sand for Rolls-Royce when it appeared in 2009: the beginning of a transformation that took the company's annual production volume from hundreds of to several thousand cars per year.The Rolls-Royce Ghost is a full-sized luxury car manufactured by Rolls-Royce Motor Cars. The "Ghost" nameplate, named in honour of the Silver Ghost, a car first produced in 1906, was announced in April 2009 at the Auto Shanghai show. </p>

                  <p>The new Bentley Continental GT Speed Convertible* is born to thrill. Powered by an immense W12 engine and a specially calibrated powertrain, it puts 650 brake horsepower at your disposal, turning open-air grand touring into pure driving excitement.Its dramatic convertible design is enhanced with exclusive Speed details to create an aggressive and athletic style that is as bold with the roof up, as it is irresistible with it down.

                    <h2 class="lg-heading"><strong> Mercedes-Maybach S-Class</strong></h2>
                    <p>The richest and most special car in what might be the most universally respected and admired limousine range in the world, the Mercedes-Maybach S-Class is the modern standard-bearer for Daimler’s Maybach super-luxury brand. To judge by appearances, you’d say it was at least as much S-Class as Maybach, and that’s the result of Daimler’s strategic decision, taken a few years ago, to broaden the reach of the Maybach marque by creating ‘halo’ Maybach models.</p>

                    <h2 class="lg-heading"><strong>Lexus LS 500</strong></h2>
                    <p>The LS is Lexus's top-tier sedan, with things like 28-way power seats, an immensely quiet interior, and a twin-turbo engine with enough grunt to rocket the car to 60 mph in just 4.5 seconds.

                    <h2 class="lg-heading"><strong>Alpina B7</strong></h2>
                    <p>BIf it is exclusivity you crave, do not be fooled by the BMW badge on the long bonnet of the Alpina B7. Of all the supremely special and rare cars on this list, perhaps only the Mercedes-Maybach is as unlikely to hove into your view on public roads, and the typical B7 price-tag of close to £200,000 after options reflects that.

                    <h2 class="lg-heading"><strong>Mercedes-AMG S65</strong></h2>
                    <p>Though soon to be overhauled, with the all-new S-Class as the base car, the mechanical make-up of the top-of-the-range performance version of the outgoing S-Class limousine hasn’t changed much in more than a decade.It’s an engine capable of sending a two-and-a-quarter-tonne, 5.3-metre-long, rear-driven limousine from 0-62mph in just 4.2sec – and that’s before it’s really settled down, found its legs and got going, don’t forget.

                    <h2 class="lg-heading"><strong>Porsche Panamera Turbo Executive</strong></h2>
                    <p>If the regular Panamera Turbo or Turbo Sport Turismo just won't cut it for you, Porsche also offers an extended-wheelbase Executive trim. It's identical in spec to the regular Turbo, with a more roomy back seat and extra rear comfort features.

                    <p>The GLS 600 is Mercedes's first Maybach-branded SUV, and it certainly lives up to the name. With some wildly ostentatious looks and a massive rear seating area, it has everything you need to cruise the outback in perfect comfort.

                    <p>No matter what you think of GM, you have to give the company credit for the Escalade. The interior is a lovely space to spend time in, and there is a ton of modern tech to play with.

                    <p>The G90 might be one of the cheapest cars on this list (when new, anyway), but it's also one of the most well-equipped and unique. Brand new for 2020, it has things like assisted driving features, active noise cancelation, and even the ability to auto-suggest a seating position for maximum comfort.</p>
