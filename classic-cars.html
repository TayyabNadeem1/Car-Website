                <p>Almost everyone has a fantasy that involves a super-cool car. Here's how to get behind the wheel.</p>

                    <p>Once called "the most beautiful car ever made" by Enzo Ferrari, the 1960s Jaguar E-Type is a classic sports car mainstay. "If you only choose one car from this list to drive, this is the one," says McKeel Hagerty, CEO of Hagerty, the world's largest provider of collector vehicle insurance.</p>

                  <p>The emblem of Big Three muscle cars, the Chevy Corvette is the most collected vehicle in America. The second generation, which spanned 1963 to 1967, is "the most iconic American car ever made," says Keith Martin, publisher of Sports Car Market. "It's still breathtaking and fresh today." </p>

                    <p>Considered by some to be the sexiest car ever built, the Miura debuted in 1966 as a sleek mid-engine speedster designed to challenge Ferrari. "Piloting the Miura transcends driving experience to become a life experience," Hagerty says. "If the sound of six carburetors feeding a thirsty, vibrating V-12 moored right behind your head isn't enough, it's also arguably the most beautiful car ever produced."</p>

                    <p>The Porsche 911 represents vintage driving at its bestâ€”particularly during the golden era before the car's 1974 redesign. "There's magic in the early 911," Hagerty says. "It's an amazingly well-built machine that delivers one of the most honest driving experiences of any sports car ever built."

                    <p>Based on the first full-size car Rolls-Royce made after the war, the original Silver Dawn drophead launched in 1949 and retired in 1954. The name was intended to mark the dawn of a new era for the world and Rolls-Royce's place in it. Slightly smaller than pre-war cars, the Dawn helped the British bespoke carmaker reintroduce motoring craftsmanship while bringing the company into the modern age.

                    <p>Among the first sports cars of the post-war era, the Mercedes SL 300 Gullwing was the fastest production car of its time when it was introduced in 1954. As the first direct fuel injection series production car, the SL 300 could travel at an eye-popping 160 miles per hour. "Nobody expected something like that from Mercedes," says Constantin von Kageneck, a specialist in classic car marketing at the Mercedes-Benz Classic Center in Irvine, CA.

                    <h2 class="lg-heading"><strong>Aston Martin DB4</strong></h2>
                    <p>The precursor to James Bond's getaway car, the Aston Martin DB4 is an iconic workhorse. "The DB4 is a thoroughbred that never gets flustered," Hagerty says. "I wouldn't hesitate to drive one across the country. It's no wonder that James Bond favored the derivative DB5." They're in short supply, so if you want to drive one, your best bet may be to befriend a collector.

                    <h2 class="lg-heading"><strong>DeTomaso Pantera</strong></h2>
                    <p>With Italian styling and a reliable Ford V8 engine, the DeTomaso Pantera represents the best of both worlds and is a worthy alternative to similar Lamborghinis and Ferraris from the same era. "You'd expect an early '70s Italian car to be garish, loud, and hard to drive," Hagerty says. "While it is garish and loud, the Italian-bodied and American-powered Pantera is actually rather easy to drive." Procure one at a high-end classic car auction house, such as Barrett-Jackson or Bonhams

                    <p>The Datsun 240Z started the Japanese sports car craze when it arrived in America in the early 1970's. Offering lots of power and a pleasant interior for not much money, the Datsun paved the way for Toyota, Honda and Nissan to gain acceptance with U.S. consumers in the following decades. Classified ads from Hemmings and AutoTrader Classics have many Datsun 240Zs listed for sale.

                    <h2 class="lg-heading"><strong>Ferrari 250 GTO</strong></h2>
                    <p>Ferrari made just 39 of these elegant race cars between 1962 and 1964, so they are extremely rare. "The 250 GTO is probably the holy grail in terms of value and recognition, but the reality is only a handful of people in the world will ever have the chance to legitimately drive one," Hagerty says.</p>
